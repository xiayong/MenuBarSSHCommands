## Installation

1. Clone the Source Code
2. Build the project using Xcode (I don't know how to distribute it yet.)
3. Move MenuBarSSHCommands.app to Applications
4. Open MenuBarSSHCommands App
5. Edit the JSON as required (via clicking Edit in the MenuBarSSHCommands app in the Menu Bar)

**Sidenote**: *As this app is not Sandboxed (Sandbox apps cant run terminal commands) it has been released as Open Source for security. Any Support appreciated.*
